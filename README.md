## Introduction

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection of AD is crucial for effective treatment and management. This project implements an ensemble approach combining EfficientNet-B2 and VGG16 models for the detection of Alzheimer's disease using MRI images.

Key features of this implementation include:
- Use of ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic) technique for addressing class imbalance in the dataset
- Ensemble approach combining EfficientNet-B2 and VGG16 models
- Feature concatenation to leverage the strengths of both models

The motivation behind this research is to improve the accuracy and reliability of AD detection using deep learning techniques. By leveraging the strengths of multiple models, addressing class imbalance issues, and combining features through concatenation, we aim to contribute to the development of more effective diagnostic tools for AD.

## Dataset

The project uses the Alzheimer's Dataset (4 class of images) available on Kaggle:


This dataset contains MRI images categorized into four classes:
- Mild Demented
- Moderate Demented
- Non Demented
- Very Mild Demented




## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3.7+ installed. Clone this repository and install the required packages:

```bash
[git clone https://github.com/cse-kiet/PCSE25-51.git]
cd PCSE25-51.git
```

## Usage

1. Download the notebooks 

2. Go to Kaggle > Code > New notebook

3. Import the notebook

4. Add the Alzheimer's Dataset (4 class of Images) dataset as input.

5. Run the cells!
